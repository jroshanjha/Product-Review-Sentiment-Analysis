# -Product-Review-Sentiment-Analysis

# ðŸ’¬ Sentiment Analysis System â€“ CProduct-Review-Analysis

Objective: Analyze Product reviews and classify them as positive or negative.
I have download dataset from Kaggle <br>
ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing:
1. Removed white spaces, punctuation, and stop words to clean and normalize textual data. 

2. Handled case normalization and noise reduction for better token consistency.

# ðŸ§  Text Processing & Feature Engineering:
1. Utilized NLTK for tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization to reduce words to their base form.

2. Applied Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into meaningful numerical feature vectors.

# ðŸ¤– Model Training:
1. Trained various ML models including Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM for sentiment prediction.

2. Compared model performance using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.

# ðŸ“ˆ Results:
1. Achieved high classification accuracy in distinguishing between positive and negative reviews.

2. Demonstrated effectiveness of feature engineering and preprocessing in improving model performance.

# Deployment Using Github and Docker (CI/CD Pipeline)

ðŸ§  Explanation:
web: tells Render this is a web service.

gunicorn is a production-ready server.

app:app refers to:

The Python file name app.py (left side)

The Flask app object app inside app.py (right side)


# Procfile
web: gunicorn app:app


# âœ… Step 3: Build and run Docker locally
docker build -t jroshan/review-app .

# Docker Images
docker images

# Rund Docker App
docker run -p 5000:5000 jroshan/review-app


## docker port , host
docker psc

## push docker image into docker container
docker login ( jroshan)

docker image rm -f review-app

# rename 
docker tag jroshan/chatbot jroshan/review-app


# push 
docker push jroshan/review-app
docker push jroshan/review-app:lates

docker pull jroshan/review-app:latest

# final :- 
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 jroshan/review-app:latest

# âœ… 4. Access in Browser
http://localhost:5000
http://127.0.0.1:5000/


# âœ… Option 5: Streamlit Community Cloud
Fastest for basic apps, no Docker required.

Steps:
Push your Streamlit project to GitHub

Go to streamlit.io/cloud

Click "New App" â†’ choose your repo

Set app.py as the entry file

Click Deploy


# Challening :- 

mkdir -p ~/.nltk_data
